A couple of years I was involved in a low-speed\ngetoff in which I landed on my back on the pavement.  My head (helmeted)\nhit the pavement with a \"clunk\", leaving a couple of dings and chips in the\npaint at the point of impact, but no other visible damage.  I called the\nhelmet manufacturer and inquired about damage.  They said that the way a\nfiberglass shell works is to first give, then delaminate, then crack.\nThis is the way fiberglass serves to spread the force of the impact over a\nwider area.  After the fiberglass has done its thing, the crushable foam\nliner takes care of absorbing (hopefully) the remaining impact force.\nThey told me that the second stage of fiberglass functionality (delamination\nof the glass\/resin layers) can occur with NO visible signs, either inside or\noutside of the helmet.  They suggested that I send them the helmet and they\nwould inspect it (including X-raying).  I did so.  They sent back the helmet\nwith a letter stating that that they could find no damage that would\ncompromise the ability of the helmet to provide maximum protection.\n(I suspect that this letter would eliminate their being able to claim\nprior damage to the helmet in the event I were to sue them.)\n\nThe bottom line, though, is that it appears that a helmets integrity\ncan be compromised with no visible signs.

{"prompt":"From: edw@boi.hp.com (Edward Walsh)\nSubject: Guzzi 850-T tires, plus fairing question\nOrganization: Hewlett-Packard \/ Boise, Idaho\nX-Newsreader: Tin 1.1 PL4\nLines: 59\n\n\n\n\nI have a question about tires for my Guzzi. It is a '75 850-T. The tires that\nwere on it when I just bought it are old and cracked. I do not have an\nowners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are:\nFront, 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18, and pressures recommended are 26 front and\n33 rear. Oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psi\ninstead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though, the pressure I should run\nat is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase.\n\nThe real question I have is this. The old tires that are on the bike are for\nthe front, a Metzler Touring Special, 4.10 H 18, and for the rear an Avon\nRoadrunner 4.70 H 18, (120\/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are larger\nthan that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend,\nand was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my first\nmotorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner\ntube qualities?\n\nThe above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current\nrear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought\n100\/90 H 18 on the front and 120\/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be\nvery good at getting close to matching mail order prices.\n\nI am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the\nfront and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer \nlasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and\nFJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drive\nbehavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable\nback end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as giving\nmuch better tire milage life. Any comments?\n\nA friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very\ngood, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to\nmount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be\ncareful, any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim to\ncheck out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and\nI havn't had a chance to check the rim type.\n\nOn another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?)\nVetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually\nI would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could be\nfork\/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame\nmounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lower\nbars\/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition\nrunner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly\naccurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe'\nstyle. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is\njust that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)\n\n-----------------------------Edward Walsh----Hewlett-Packard Company-------\n                             edw@boi.hp.com  Disk Memory Division, MS475\n                             (208)323-2174   P.O.

Dropped my Shoei RF-200 off the seat of my bike while trying to rock \nit onto it's centerstand, chipped the heck out of the paint on it...\n \n So I cheerfully spent $.59 on a bottle of testor's model paint and \nrepainted the scratches and chips for 20 minutes.\n \n Then, while it was drying, I realized that I was out of smokes and that my \ncage is not currently running... So I \"had to\" take my bike down to the \nstore. Not wanting to mess up my paint job, I said \"Well, heck. I can just \nuse my old helmet\".... this is your standard el cheapie openface... \n  \n I didn't notice a big difference when I switched TO the shoei, but \nswitching back was really bad... \n \n 1) Doesn't fit worth a damn, too wide in the sides, too short front to \nback...\n 2) With a faceplate, it's still bloody windy... with the shoei, I normally \nignore the face shield until I get up to about 30ish... with this one, \ntaxiing to the end of the driveway was too smegging much wind. \n \n  \n \n The question for the day is re: passenger helmets, if you don't know for \ncertain who's gonna ride with you (like say you meet them at a .... church \nmeeting, yeah, that's the ticket)...

In the early 80's with the\nfuel crisis, etc., everyone wanted better fuel mileage.  Diesel fuel\nwas the cheapest fuel available and usually provides better mileage\nthan comparable gasoline engines.  So, GM decided to conver their\n350 gas engine into a diesel engine (I think was a 5.7 liter).  Big\nmistake.  The engine was not redesigned, but converted.  The engine\ncould not handle the higher compression, etc.  Lots of problems with\nthese cars.  This thew up a big red flag to the casual observer --\nDON\"T BUY A DIESEL.  THEY ARE BAD.  This was a gross generalization.\n\nAsk yourself this question -- if your livelihood depended on driving,\nLOTS of it, would you use a dependable or undependable (but cheaper\nin the short run) vehicle?  What do Greyhound busses have in them?\nTrailer Trucks?  Even Train Locomotives?  Are these gasoline engines?\nNo, they are diesel.  Tractor trailer truck manufacturers provide a\n500,000 mile warrantee with they vehicles.\n\nI own an `82 Diesel Suburban.  The 6.2L diesel is a GREAT engine.\nJust keeps going.  It was more expensive (when new) than the gasoline\nengine vehicle was.  The only problem with diesel engines is that \nwhen they need to be rebuilt, they are expensive.  In a gas 350\nengine, you will pay about $1000 for a rebuild.  Diesel 6.2L is about\n$2000.  But then again, the diesel engine lasts about twice as long\nand gets about 50% better mileage.  A carburator for a gasoline engine\ncosts about $100 to rebuild (or less).  A rebuild of the fuel injection\npump on a diesel will cost about $500 (or more).  But then again,\nyou never need a tune-up.\n\nIf you're looking at a rebuilt 6.2L, I'd say you got a great deal.\nCheck to see if the fuel injection pump was rebuilt also.\n\nGood luck.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" autos"}

But the demonstration of this\nproduct really impressive, if it didn't cheat.\n\nThe setup of the demo is fairly simple. A cone shaped rotor is\nhalf submerged in a small oil sink, filled with motor oil. The rotor\nis powered by an electronic motor. A metal pad is pressed against\nthe rotor using the torque wrench until the rotor stopped by friction. \nThe torque that is needed to stop rotor is read from the torque wrench.\n\nBefore MILITECH was added, the rotor was stopped with about 60 lb-ft\nof torque (You pick the brand of oil, no difference). Once MILITECH was \nadded to the oil, the rotor could not be stopped even with 120+ lb-ft of\ntorque. \n\nHere is the good part: even after the salesman emptied the oil sink, \nyou still could not stopped the rotor with the thin film remained  on it.\n\nThey say you need only add 2oz per quart of oil every 15k miles. A 16 oz\nbottle is $25.\n\nI still have my doubts. If this product is really so great, why it was\nso little known? The salesman said it is widely used in military. I didn't\nbelieve it.

At a tuned engine rpm, the\nstacks can greatly increase the speed, and thus momentum of the air\nrushing in.\nAir momentum is critical in getting good air intake: the momentum of\nthe air stack outside the combustion chamber will force its way inside\nlong after the piston has begun its compressive up-stroke.\nShock waves are used to induce air intake and to prevent fresh air from\nescaping out the exzhaust ports.  Shock waves are the product of expansion\nchambers or any other means of presenting a 'wall' (opening or closing)\nto the air in motion.

The SAE numbers are based on a `typical'\ncurve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a\nroom-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature \n5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil.\n\nOils that are designed for operation in `normal' temperatures just have\na weight specification.  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly\ncold temperatures have a `W' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold\nplace, you'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer,\nto approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.\n\nModern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature.\nAs a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-vis\nspecification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal' operating\ntemperature and a `cold' one (though I can't remember the numbers...).\n\nIn any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  Remember\nthat your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and\nradiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or\nsomething.\n\nAny weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized\noil.  Thin oil won't (in general) lubricate as well at temperature,\nthicker oil will (like a 20W50) will lubricate better at temperature, \nbut not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs.  \n\nIf you're planning on making long drives, the 20W50 is probably fine\n(esp. in the summer) in your 10W40 car.  But if you're making short drives,\nstick to the 10W40.\n\n\n--\nDON'T DRINK SOAP! DILUTE DILUTE! OK!\n\n###\n\n","completion":" autos"}

On major highways, 3 or more\nlanes in each direction, keeping to the extreme right blocks folks who\nare entering. Also, as someone posted in this thread, here in the D.C.\narea we have a few left lane exits (sounds like 66). If you wait until\nthe last minute to get in the left lane you won't, cause these yoyos\nwon't make room.\n\nWe have a particularly bad strech here in Merryland just over the Cabin\nJohn bridge. There are two very long entry ramps which all the hurry-up\nyahoos dive into cause they want to get ahead. When we get to the point\nwhere these ramps merge, all hell breaks lose. The result is that traffic\nwhich was moving at 55 on the VA side of the bridge, stalls on t'other\nside. If these dingbats had stayed in lane, allowed the folks coming up\nthe two ramps to merge, we would still be doing 55. Instead we do start-\nstop for 4 miles. Dave Barry's idea of a laser equipped car would be\nreal useful here.\n\nBob\n\nPS: If you drive the beltway and want to merge, look for a brown Probe\nwith a silver haired driver, then use your signals - I don't read minds,\nbut I do try to be courteous.
