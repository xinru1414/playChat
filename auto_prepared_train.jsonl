Everybody's got an\nopinion and is dead certain they are right.  Yet acurate information is\nextremely difficult to come by.  The DMV doesn't know.  Cops don't\nknow.  Your traffic school instructor doesn't know.  The vehicle code\nonly tells part of the story.  Judges choose to interpret the laws in a\nwide variety of ways.  And the public at large?  I seldom hear any\nadvice that doesn't disagree with something I've experienced.\n\nIf you don't believe me I suggest you get a copy of the vehicle code,\nstudy it, and then sit in on a day or two of court and see what really\nhappens.  Read \"Fight Your Ticket\" too, but don't miss the little\nsection at the end where it says your chances are lousy and you're\nbasically screwed.\n\nAs you may have guessed, I'm pretty down on the system here in\nCalifornia.

{"prompt":"From: frank@marvin.contex.com (Frank Perdicaro)\nSubject: ST1100 ride\nKeywords: heavy\nLines: 95\n\nSixteen days I had put off test driving the Honda ST1100.  Finally,\nthe 17th was a Saturday without much rain.  In fact it cleared up, \nbecame warm and sunny, and the wind died.  About three weeks ago, I\ntook a long cool ride on the Hawk down to Cycles! 128 for a test ride.\nThey had sold, and delivered, the demo ST1100 about fifteen hours\nbefore I arrived.  And the demo VFR was bike-locked in the showroom --\nsurrounded by 150 other bikes, and not likely to move soon.\n\nToday was different.  There were even more bikes.  50 used dirt bikes,\n50 used street bikes, 35 cars, and a big tent full of Outlandishly Fat\nTouring Bikes With Trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot.\nSome sort of fat bike convention.  Shelly and Dave were running one\nMSF course each, at the same time.  One in the classroom and one on\nthe back lot.  Plus, there was the usuall free cookout food that\nCycles! gives away every weekend in the summer.  Hmmm, it seemed like\na big moto party.\n\nAfter about ten minutes of looking for Rob C, cheif of sales slime,\nand another 5 minutes reading and signing a long disclosure\/libility\/\npray-to-god form I helped JT push the ST out into the mess in the\nparking lot.  We went over the the controls, I put the tank bag from \nthe Hawk into the right saddlebag, and my wife put everything else\ninto the left saddlebag.  ( Thats nice.... )  Having helped push the \nST out to the lot, I thought it best to have JT move it to the edge of\nthe road, away from the 100+ bikes and 100+ people.  He rode it like a\nbicycle!  'It cant be that heavy' I thought.\n\nWell I was wrong.  As I sat on the ST, both feet down, all I could \nthink was \"big\".  Then I put one foot up.  \"Heavy\" came to mind very\nquickly.  With Cindy on the back -- was she on the back?  Hard to \ntell with seat three times as large as a Hawk seat -- the bike seemed\nnearly out of control just idling on the side of the road.\n\nBy 3000 rpm in second gear, all the weight seemed to dissappear.  Even\non bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer, slippery new tires, and pads that \ndid not yet bite the disks, things seems smooth and sure.  Cycles! is\non a section of 128 that few folks ever ride.  About 30 miles north\nof the computer concentration, about five miles north of where I95\nsplits away, 128 is a lighly travelled, two lane limited access\nhighway.  It goes through heavily forested sections of Hamilton, \nManchester-by-the-Sea and Newbury on its way to Gloucester.\nOn its way there, it meets 133, a road that winds from the sea about\n30 miles inland to Andover.  On its way it goes through many\nthoroughly New England spots.  Perfect, if slow, sport touring sections.\n\nCindy has no difficulty with speed.  3rd gear, 4th gear, purring along\nin top gear.  This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Hawk.  Lane \nchanges were a new experience.  A big heft is required to move this \nthing.  Responds well though.   No wallowing or complaint.  Behind the\nfairing it was fairly quiet, but the helmet buffeting was\nnon-trivial.  Top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless.\nSmooth, smooth, smooth.   Not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of,\nbut it is pleasant.  If only the bars were not transmitting an endless\nbuzz.\n\nThe jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with the\nbrakes.  Its a down hill, reversing camber, twice-reversing radius,\ndecreasing radius turn.  A real squeeze is needed on the front binder.  \nThe section of 133 we were on was tight, but too urban.  The ST works ok\nin this section, but it shows its weight.  We went by the clam shack\noft featured in \"Spencer for Hire\" -- a place where you could really \nfind \"Spencer\", his house was about 15 miles down 133.  After putting\nthrough traffic for a while, we turned and went back to 128.\n\nAbout half way through the onramp, I yanked Cindy's wrist, our singal\nfor \"hold on tight\".  Head check left,  time to find redline.  Second\ngear gives a good shove.  Third too.  Fourth sees DoD speed with a \nshort shift into top.  On the way to 133 we saw no cops and very light\ntraffic.  Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too new.\nWell, now it had 25 miles on it, so it was ok.  Tried some high effort\nlane changes, some wide sweeping turns.  Time to wick it up?  I went \nuntil the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat.  And stayed\nthere.  When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering, \nI looked down to find an indicated 135mph.  Not bad for 2-up touring.\n\nBeverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit.  At the \"get\noff in a mile\" sign, I rolled off the throttle and coasted.  I wanted\nto re-adjust to the coming slowness.  It was a good idea:  there were\nseveral manhole-sized patches of sand on the exit ramp.  Back to the \nslow and heavy behavior.  Cycles! is about a mile from 128.  I could \nsee even more cars stacked up outside right when I got off.  I managed\nto thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad\nout front.  Heavy.  It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to put\nthe thing on the center stand.  I am sure that if I used the side\nstand the ST would have been on its side within a minute.\n\n\nMy demo opinion?  Heavy.  Put it on a diet.  Smooth, comfortable,\nhardly notices the DoD speed.   I'd buy on for about $3000 less than \nlist, just like it is.  Too much $ for the bike as it is.\n-- \n\t Frank Evan Perdicaro \t\t\t\tXyvision Color Systems\n      Legalize guns, drugs and cash...today.\t\t101 Edgewater Drive\n   inhouse: frank@marvin, x5572\t\t\t\tWakefield MA\nouthouse: frank@contex.com, 617-245-4100x5572\t\t018801285\n\n###\n\n","completion":" motorcycles"}

This article\nwill provide the essential information for doing so on standard\nUnix systems.  A shell script and examples of alias file setups\nare included which presently run on a Sparc 2 here at balltown.cma.com\nfor a number of mailing lists.  Note that if you do set up an automotive\nmailing list, please let me know of the -request address so that I can\nlist it in the montly rec.autos posting.  Also inform the keeper of the\nUsenet list-of-lists (check news.answers for this monthly posting.)\n\nFirst of all, to get anywhere, you need to either 1) be a sysadmin,\nor 2) have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin.  It is also\nimportant that you have reasonably good network connectivity; if it seems\nlike you get everything several days after anyone else, or that you\nhave trouble getting email through, then your network connectivity is\nprobably not good enough.\n\nListserv:\n\nThere is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv, which\nis available from several ftp servers on the network.  Details of\nthe installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of this\narticle, but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list should\nprobably  look at listserv carefully.\n\nThe Alias file:\n\nOn a typical unix system; there is a file named \/usr\/lib\/aliases on\nwhichever file server is your mail host; it contains lines such as:\n\nfoo:   bar, baz, bletch\n\n\nwhich means that any email sent the name `foo' on that host is\nredistributed to users bar, baz, and bletch.  thus, the simplest\npossible email list is \n\nmy-favorite-car:  member1, member2, member3, my-address\nmy-favorite-car-request: my-address\n\nthis has a couple of problems; the most noticeable one being that\nyou have to be superuser to edit the alias file.  however, you can\ndo the following, with the connivance of your sysadmin:\n\nmy-favorite-car: :include:\/home\/mydir\/misc\/autos\/my-favorite-car-list\nmy-favorite-car-request: my-address\n\nWhere the file specified is a list of comma and newline separated\naddresses.  This file can be in the list admin's home directory,\nowned by the list admin.\n\nBounced Mail:\n\nthis still has a problem; bounced mail usually gets distributed to all the\nmembers of the list, which is generally considered somewhat irritating.\nTherefore, the way that the driving school mailing list is set up\nis instructive (Thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup,\nby the way.  I'm not sure where he got it from.)\n\n\nschool-request:   welty\nschool-rebroadcast:  :include:\/home\/newwelty\/misc\/autos\/school\/list\nschool: \"|\/usr\/local\/adm\/bin\/explscript school\"\nowner-school: school-request\nowner-school-out: school-request\n\n\nhere's what is going on here:\n\nthe owner- and -request addresses are intended as traps for bounced mail\ncoming from the network.  the -request address also serves as the point\nof contact for administrative duties.\n\nschool is what people send mail to; instead of pointing at addresses,\nit points at a shell script which rewrites headers before resending\nthe email.  school-broadcast (of which nobody except me knows the name;\nthe name has been changed here to protect my own sanity) points at the\nactual list members.\n\nthe shell script i use is as follows:\n\n-----------------\n#!\/bin\/sh\ncd \/tmp\nsed -e '\/^Reply-To:\/d' -e '\/^Sender:\/d' -e '\/^From \/d' | \\\n        (echo Reply-To: ${1}@balltown.cma.com; \\\n         echo Errors-To: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\n         echo Sender: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\\n         cat -) | \\\n        \/usr\/lib\/sendmail -om -f ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com \\\n                -F \"The ${1} Mailing List\" ${1}-rebroadcast\nexit 0\n-------------------\n\nnote that this script does not know the name of the list; the name\nis passed in from outside, so that the script may be used for multiple\nlists (i run several out of this site.)\nthe script excises Reply-To:, Sender:, and From lines from the incoming\nmessage, substitutes for Sender: and Reply-To:, and adds Errors-to:\n99.9% of all email bounce messages end up being sent to the -request\nor owner- addresses if this header rewrite is done.\n\nFor digested lists, there is some digestification software around.\nHopefully I'll be able to provide more information in a future version\nof this posting.\n\nrichard welty (welty@balltown.cma.com)\n-- \nrichard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\n``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of\n  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith\n\n###\n\n","completion":" autos"}

Do the gases really \n>compress that much?\n\n    For discussion purposes, I will ignore dynamic effects like pulses\nin the exhaust pipe, and try to paint a useful mental picture.\n\n1.  Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force\nair into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake\nvalve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only\nthe difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after\nthe exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the\nintake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing\natmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time\ndoes the pressure ever become \"negative\", or even approach a good\nvacuum.\n\n2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the\ncombustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up\nto the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume\nof gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume\nthat must flow through the intake, because of the temperature\ndifference and the products of combustion.\n\n3.  In the last 6-8 years, the Japanese manufacturers have started\npaying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almighty\nhorsepower.  At this point in time, on high-performance bikes,\nsubstitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost\nzero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very\nwell anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make\nvery little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is\n_much_ louder than the stocker.\n\n4.

Was\nDS>that the one with the little illuminated Dragon's Head on the front\nDS>fender, a style later copied by Indian, and the round side covers?\n\nNo. Not at all. The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when\n(forties? fifties?) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing.\nThe first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to Max\nFriz's famous design, but with an overhead \"point cam\" (see below for\nmore on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no ground\nclearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so\nthat the ground clearance was substantially increased:\n\n\n      ==@==   <-Springer motor (front)\n                 Viking motor (front) ->   \\=@=\/\n\nThis is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved\naround a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn\nin the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connecting\nrods to accomodate the stroke.\n\nThe engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still\nunique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing and\nand extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was\nrequired to drive both overhead valves.\n\nJust as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a\npressurized stream of oil to power the \"waterwheel\" which kept the lobe\nspinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutal\nengineering fixes was that until the engine's oil pressure came up to\nnormal, the engine's valve timing would be more or less random,\nresulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was a\nlittle hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the\nbeast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to\npressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however,\nuses an electric oil pump. Wimps).\n\nDespite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively\nfiring its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily\nlose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. The solution was to run even\nhigher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. This\nwas feasible because it was a racing engine.\n\nWith just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod\/shaft\/chain towers\nbecause of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to an\nalmost perfect point:\n\n                    \/\\\n                   \/()\\   <-lobe\n                  \/ XX \\  <-complex linkage (not shown due to\n valvestems ->   \/ \\  \/ \\    complexity)\n                |  |   | |\n                |  |===| |\n                    =0=  <---piston\n                     |\n                             Note that the tip was not truly vertical\n                             (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the\n                             ground, and this drawing doesn't show the\n                             curvature because there was none in the\n                             head itself. The bore curve would start\n                             about where the cylinder bore disappears in\n                             this diagram\n\n\nThe effect of the pointy heads on top of a pair of gently (pundits of\nthe day even said sensuously) curved cylinders was much like a pair of\nfinned Viking horns poking out from beneath the gas tank. Thus, the\nname.\n\nThe Vik was a moderately successful racer, lightning fast when it\nworked, but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionary\ntechnology. Eventually, it was dumped when Spag finally realized that\nracing was not where the Spagthorpe name would be made. The machines\nwere raced for another year or two by privateers, and their fate\n(approximately six Vikings were made, plus one or possibly two\nSpringers. Confusing the issue is one old Spag staffer who swears up and\ndown that this machine was tooled for production, and that as many as\ntwenty or thirty machines may have come off the line.

(BTW, as of a\ncouple years ago, the most stolen bikes in Orange County and SF were 750\nGSX's and Ninjas). Probably the biggest reason BMWs aren't ripped off is that\nmost people who buy BMWs will only deal with the actual BMW dealer, or mail-\norder types. Most of these can have their inventory checked fairly easily\nby law-enforcement types, and their mark-up is usually sufficient to keep \nthem honest about acquiring parts. \n\nFor Harleys and rice-rockets, you've got 2 different situations. There is a\nHUGE aftermarket in Harley parts, so a bike can be parted out fairly easily.\nDitto the non-sport Japanese bikes, but the prices on the parts for these are\nnot as high, comparatively. For the 'rockets', anytime a bike goes down, the \nplastic is usually cracked, and is expensive to replace. It's fairly easy,\nthen, for a disreputable shop to take a fairing from a stolen bike, slap it\non a bike in for repair, repaint it, and make a tidy profit. The other parts,\nmore traceable, can be used, or discarded if they are too traceable.\n\nMike\n-- \nDisclaimer - These opiini^H^H damn! ^H^H ^Q ^[ .... :w  :q  :wq  :wq! ^d  ^X ^?\nexit X Q  ^C ^? :quitbye  CtrlAltDel   ~~q  :~q  logout  save\/quit :!QUIT\n^[zz ^[ZZZZZZ ^vi  man vi ^@  ^L  ^[c  ^# ^E ^X ^I ^T ? help  helpquit ^D  ^d !!\nman help ^C ^c :e! help exit ?Quit ?q CtrlShftDel \"Hey, what does Stop L1A d...\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" motorcycles"}

If it's a choice\nbetween injuring\/killing a dog or getting yourself injured\/killed, there is\nonly one rational decision.  Only the most insane animal rights kook would put\nthe dog first.\n\nSecond, it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language.  How you react\nto a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you're\nplaying with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog which\nhas hostile intent.\n\nThird, it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are social\nbeasts, and recognize a domination\/submission hierarchy.  To a dog, there are\ntwo types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates, and that which\ndominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the\nlatter class.  You are God: you are easily angered and your anger is terrible.\nBut God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance, and may\neven on rare occasions dispense a kind word, a kind word, or even (oh joy oh\nrapture unforeseen) A Dog Bisquit!\n\nNow, how does that all relate to biking?  Well, first, it's a good idea to\nassume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a\ngame, and not out of overt hostility.  The MSF suggestion is a very good one;\nwhen you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place of\ninterception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle so\nthat when he reaches it you're already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds to\nreact to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a\nmotorcycle is capable of.\n\nWith a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measures\nmay be necessary.  This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important\n-- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on the\nroad, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled up\nnewspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will\nhurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is\nthat you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The\nlarger the dog, the greater your anger.\n\nDogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and he\nare not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he\nis on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death.\n\nMost dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory\nwhere there is at least a home advantage.  They'll also observe that you are\nsatisfied by that retreat (gesture of submission) and thus they have escaped\npunishment.\n\nThe interesting thing about dogs is that body language communicates a great\ndeal to them.  The more effective you are at communicating body language, the\nless you actually have to do.  After 7 years with my 93 pound beast, I've\nlearned a few tricks I think...\n\n###\n\n","completion":" motorcycles"}

I have no idea how either of my Hondas will handle at 100+ mph,\nnor do they reach 155. However, using `high' to be 70-90 mph:\n\na) They are quite amenable to long high speed drives. I've done several\n1k mile+ trips in my Civic with no problems whatsoever. The last big trip\nI made was driving from New York to Texas. I remember driving 700-800\nmiles a day at typically 75-85 mph  without any problems. I'm sure I  \nwould have been more comfortable driving a benz, but no white knuckles.\nNo problems with winds and curves. \n\nThen there was the trip back from New Orleans after Mardi Gras - where\nwe were doing 80+ all the way to Houston. No problems.\n\nb) Both my cars have surprising good fuel economy at high speeds. I see\nno difference between sustained 60 mph and sustained 80mph.

My car has 11,500\nmiles on it and is a '92 model.  The NX2000 the dealer is selling is a '91\nmodel with 23,000miles on it.  It has a T-Bar Roof, a\/c, and an airbag,\nwhich my Sentra does not have.  They are asking for $1500.  Is that a fair\ndeal?  The only thing I noticed about the NX2000 is that the engine did not\nseem to have as much torque as my Sentra which has the same identical\nengine.  I presume that the last lady owner did not really push the engine\nto it's limits occassionaly while I did that on mine, thuis the NX2000's\nengine is a little \"tight.\"  So, if I buy the NX2000 and \"excercise\" it\nwell, should that slight power problem go away?  Any advice on this will be\nmuch appreciated.  Thanks.

Hence, any apparent\n>similarity in handling characteristics may, or may *not* be analagous\n>in its underlying physics to that behind motorcycle handling\n>characteristics.\n\nOK, as one last attempt, I'll take a different tack.\n\nWe all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why\none can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle. The question is,\nis one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be to\ndesign an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and\nsee which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of\nus who have bikes are familiar.\n\nLet's look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on its\nown, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have to\nget rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patches\nto transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have to\nremain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike,\nthrough suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the\nsame way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along \na dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change \nsurfaces to something that won't transmit forces through the contact \npatches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It \nprobably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice, \nbut we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like \nbecause, without the contact patches, we can't turn.  Maybe there's a \nbetter way. Besides, even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patch\nforces altogether, so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface.\nYou'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it\nwas the rotation that did it.\n\nLooking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple.\nNow we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and\ndirection of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them\nabout the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels.\nHow it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we're just looking\nfor something that has contact patches that can go straight and not\nsideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don't know of any snow-ski\nor skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged\nlike a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels.\nI think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like\nthat, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect.\nNow I admit that this is second hand info (although I'd love to try\none of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in\na bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very\nmuch like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn.\nSo we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's,\na similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have\ncountersteering.\n\nConclusion: you don't need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have\nmotorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don't know what\nreal effect the gyroscopes have when they're there, but from my observations\nof how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I'm \nwilling to bet that they're not the dominant factor in countersteering. \n\nIf you don't like this conclusion, then don't accept it, but my motorcycle's\nbehaviour is consistent with it. If someone can prove otherwise, go ahead.\n\nI've        bike                      like       | Jody Levine  DoD #275 kV\n     got a       you can        if you      -PF  | Jody.P.Levine@hydro.on.ca\n                         ride it                 | Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n\n###\n\n","completion":" motorcycles"}

Does this sound right?  Otherwise, the bike looked\ngreat.  No signs of road rash, and no rust.  This bike looks great! \nIt is now in the shop getting tuned and new tires.  \nI am opting for the Metzler ME55 and ME33 tires (thanks to those \nwho posted this other thread).

Check out the\narticle in last week's Autoweek about the crisis at VW.  Golfs and\nJettas will be coming from the plant in Mexico, but they don't have\nthe quality at that facility.  As per normal VW practice, the US\nlaunch of the Jetta III is delayed again and again, until a good chunk\nof the useful life of the design is spent.\n\nI think that Passats come from Germany, so there is not the same\nquality and availability issue.

Advantages include the fact\n    that I can later add the pants, and that it nearly eliminates\n    the need for the jacket portion of a rainsuit.\n\n2)  Buy some kind of leather jacket.  I like a few of the new \n    Hein-Gericke FirstGear line, however they may be a bit pricey\n    unless I can work some sort of deal.  Advantages of leather\n    are potentially slightly better protection, enhanced pose\n    value (we all know how important that is :-), possibly cheaper\n    than upper Aerostich.\n\nRequirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other \nlayers (mainly a sizing thing), if leather i'd prefer a zip-out \nlining, it MUST have some body armor similar to aerostich (elbows, \nshoulders, forearms, possibly back\/kidney protection, etc.), a \nreasonable amount of pocket space would be nice, ventilation would \nbe a plus, however it must be wearable in cold weather (below\nfreezing) with layers or perhaps electrics.\n\nPlease fire away with suggestions, comments, etc...\n\nSteve\n--\n-- \n Steve Andersen  DoD #0239                               andersen@me.udel.edu\n (302) 832-0136                                     andersen@zr1.ccm.udel.edu\n 1992 Ducati 907 I.E.                                      1987 Yamaha SRX250\n \"Life is simply a consequence of the complexities of carbon chemistry...\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" motorcycles"}

In most of the accidents and near accidents that I've seen, riders\nwill almost always stand on the brakes as hard as they dare, simply because\nthe instinct to brake in the face of danger is so strong that it over-rides\neverything else. Hard braking and swerving tend to be mutually exclusive\nmanouvres - did Hurt draw any conclusions on which one is generally preferable?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" motorcycles"}

{"prompt":"From: stefan@prague (Stefan Fielding-Isaacs)\nSubject: Racelist: WHO WHAT WHERE\nDistribution: rec\nOrganization: Gain Technology, Palo Alto, CA.\nLines: 111\nNntp-Posting-Host: prague.gain.com\n\n\n Greetings fellow motorcycle roadracing enthusiasts!\n\n BACKGROUND\n ----------\n\n The racing listserver (boogie.EBay.sun.com) contains discussions \n devoted to racing and racing-related topics. This is a pretty broad \n interest group. Individuals have a variety of backgrounds: motojournalism, \n roadracing from the perspective of pit crew and racers, engineering,\n motosports enthusiasts.\n\n The size of the list grows weekly. We are currently at a little\n over one hundred and eighty-five members, with contributors from\n New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, England, Canada\n Finland, Switzerland, and the United States.\n\n The list was formed (October 1991) in response to a perceived need \n to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of \n performance (roadracing) and to improve on the very low signal-to-noise \n ratio found in rec.motorcycles. Anyone is free to join.\n\n Discussion is necessarily limited by the rules of the list to \n issues related to racing motorcycles and is to be \"flame-free\".  \n\n HOW TO GET THE DAILY DISTRIBUTION\n ---------------------------------\n\n You are welcome to subscribe. To subscribe send your request to:\n\n\n        race-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\n\n\n Traffic currently runs between five and twenty-five messages per day\n (depending on the topic). \n\n   NB: Please do _not_ send your subscription request to the\n       list directly.\n \n After you have contacted the list administrator, you will receive\n an RSVP request. Please respond to this request in a timely manner\n so that you can be added to the list. The request is generated in\n order to insure that there is a valid mail pathway to your site.\n \n Upon receipt of your RSVP, you will be added to either the daily\n or digest distribution (as per your initial request).\n\n HOW TO GET THE DIGEST DISTRIBUTION\n ----------------------------------\n\n It is possible to receive the list in 'digest'ed form (ie. a\n single email message). The RoadRacing Digest is mailed out \n whenever it contains enough interesting content. Given the\n frequency of postings this appears to be about every other\n day.\n\n Should you wish to receive the list via digest (once every \n 30-40K or so), please send a subscription request to:\n\n\n        digest-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\n\n\n HOW TO POST TO THE LIST\n -----------------------\n\n This is an open forum. To post an article to the list, send to:\n\n\n        race@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\n\n\n Depending on how mail is set up at your site you may or may\n not see the mail that you have posted. If you want to see it\n (though this isn't necessarily a guarantee that it went out)\n you can include a \"metoo\" line in your .mailrc file (on UNIX\n based mail systems). \n\n BOUNCES\n -------\n\n Because I haven't had the time (or the inclination to replace\n the list distribution mechanism) we still have a problem with\n bounces returning to the poster of a message. Occasionally,\n sites or users go off-line (either leaving their place of\n employment prematurely or hardware problems) and you will receive\n bounces from the race list. Check the headers carefully, and\n if you find that the bounce originated at Sun (from whence I\n administer this list) contact me through my administration\n hat (race-request@boogie.EBay.sun.com). If not, ignore the bounce. \n\n OTHER LISTS \n -----------\n\n        Two-strokes:     2strokes@microunity.com\n        Harleys:         harley-request@thinkage.on.ca\n                         or  uunet!watmath!thinkage!harley-request\n        European bikes:  majordomo@onion.rain.com\n                         (in body of message write: subscribe euro-moto)\n\n\n thanks, be seeing you, \n Rich (race list administrator)\n\n rich@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\n-- \nStefan Fielding-Isaacs                                415.822.5654 office\/fax\ndba Art & Science              \"Books By Design\"      415.599.4876 voice\/pager\nAMA\/CCS #14\n* currently providing consulting writing services to: Gain Technology, Verity *\n\n###\n\n","completion":" motorcycles"}

When a friend of mine went shopping for a small\nsedan a few years ago, she brought me along as a token male so\nthe salespeople wouldn't give her the \"bimbo\" treatment.\nHer first choice was a Mazda 323, and second choice was a Nissan\nSentra.  We went to a Mazda dealership and described what \"we\"\nwanted.  We started negotiating on the price, and the salesdroid\nkept playing the \"let me run this price by the sales manager\".  After\nplaying the \"good salesman, bad salesman\" game, we finally told him\nthat if he didn't have the authority to negotiate a price, perhaps\nwe should be speaking directly to someone who did.  He brought in\nthe sales manager who proceeded to dick us around with every trick\nin the book.  (Read Remar Sutton's \"Don't Get Taken Every Time\" for a\nlist.)  Finally, after playing a few more rounds of \"you'll have to\nwork with us on this price\", also known as \"each time you come up a\nthousand dollars we'll come down ten\", the salesmanager gave a signal to\nhis two sales cronies, stood up, and said \"well, we can't come down any\nmore so I guess we can't help you\" and they trouped out of the room,\nleaving us sitting in the salesman's office all by ourselves.  Hmm.\nI'd read that sleazy salesmen sometimes bug their own offices so they\ncan leave and listen in on couples discussing the sales offer, and\nI mentioned this aloud to my friend while we were sitting there wondering\nwhy they would leave us in the office instead of showing us to the\ndoor.  For lack of anything better to do, I picked up the phone on\nthe desk and called another Mazda dealership, asked for a salesman,\nand began discussing what kind of price they would consider.  A few\nsentences into the conversation, Mr. Salesmanager broke into the line\n(!) and began telling me how rude he thought it was that I would call\nanother dealership from \"his\" phone!  I said that since he'd announced\nthat our business was over, he shouldn't care, and every time I tried\nto talk to the other sales guy the sales manager would drown out our\nvoices with his own.  (How did he know that I was using the phone,\nanyway?)  Finally, I hung up and we headed out of the showroom.\nSales manager and cronies come out of a little unmarked room and he\nbegins to berate us again.  We say that we won't bother him anymore,\nwe're going next door to the Nissan dealership.\n\nThen comes the part I wish I could have videotaped.  As we go out\nthe front door, the sales manager SHOUTS across the entire showroom,\ncustomers and all, \"Go ahead!  You DESERVE to buy a Nissan!\"\nSo my friend bought a Sentra.\n\nJust so the guilty won't go unpunished, I'll mention that the\nsales manager's name was Gary Tusone.  From his manner, his\nrefusal to come down to a reasonable price, and his anger at the\nend, my guess is that he had bet our original salesman (who was\na young novice) that he'd be able to get at least X dollars out of\nus, and he was steamed that we wouldn't fall for his slimy tricks.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" autos"}

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica\nGT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners\nincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).\nI narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling\n(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less\nmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury\ncar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.\nI was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i\ndecided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way.  I asked\nabout what would happen to my rate with either car.\n \n\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as\nthe Celica (the '85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that\nyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because\nthe car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue\nto handle your account.\n \n\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we'll have to change you to the standard\n[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with\na 944, it's another story again - we'll cover the rest of this year,\nbut cancel you after that.\"\n \n\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually\nfaster than the [standard] 944.  That doens't make sense.\"\n \n That's what the book says.  We don't insure Corvettes, either.  For\nsome reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -\nas very traditional and conservative.\"\n \nI eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche\ndealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure\nguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken\na year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I\nconcluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto\ntheft.\n \n   \/|\/| \/||)|\/  \/~ \/\\| |\\|)[~|)\/~   |   Everyone's entitled to MY opinion.\n  \/ | |\/ ||\\|\\  \\_|\\\/|_|\/|)[_|\\\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil\n========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======\n \n \n \n \n \n======================================================================== 32\n \nI live in Idaho.

If I moved to the absolute best it would go down to about\n$1150, if I moved to the worst it would be $2000+..\n \n\tAlso one accident and a couple of tickets, would probably add another $600...\n \n \n\t_RV\n \n \n======================================================================== 43\nI have a 1990 Mitsubishi eclipse turbo awd, am 23 years old and have no\ntickets that went on my record.  I live in Illinois just outside of Chicago\nand pay $1560 a year with full coverage at State Farm.  I did get a small\ndiscount because of my alarm system($30 a year).  I only live 15 miles from\nChicago but if I actually lived in the city the price would be about $2000\na year.\n======================================================================== 41\nI'm over 25, but in case you're interested anyway, I'm insuring a 93 SHO\nfor $287\/6 month.  Thats 100k personal+300k total+100k property with\n250 deductible, glass and towing, State Farm.\n \n======================================================================== 39\n \nUnless you are under 20 or have been driving for less than 5\nyears, I think you are being seriously ripped off.  I don't have\none of the performance cars you listed, but if your record is\nclean, then you should not be paying over $2K.\n \nDid you try calling all the insurance dealers you could find?\nAlthough rates are supposed to be standardized, I've found that\nmost places I initially call, give me some ridiculously high\nquote and *finaly*, I hit one that is much lower.\n \nAlso, I have changed insurance companies when the rate went up at\nrenewal (no accidents, tickets, car gets older??) to maintain a low\nrate.  You always have to be careful when it comes to insurance\ncompanies 8^).\n \nGood luck,\nSerge\n\n###\n\n","completion":" autos"}

The guy who bought it had a mechanic pull the valve covers\nto look at the top end, do a compression check etc.  He confirmed it was\nmint.\n\n   As for price, $4500 seems a little steep.  I bought my '90 with 12k\nmiles on it a year ago (and in absolutely cherry condition) for $4800.\nThere is a bluebook, ask your bank or credit union for the going price.\nI've seen a couple of ads for VFR's in the $4500 dollar range.  They all\nsaid low miles & mint condition but I didn't actually go look at them.\n\n   A VFR is a very sweet bike and will last you forever if you maintain\nit at all.  One thing to look for, BTW, is a soft front end.  If my\nVFR is any indication, at 12k miles the fork springs were totally shot.\nProgressive springs ($55) fixed it right up.\n\nGood luck,\n\n _______________________ K _ E _ N ____________________________\n|                                                              |\n| Ken Snyder              ms\/loc: 330 \/ UN2                    |\n| Hewlett-Packard Co.

Jacking up the frame some more\n(had to put the spare tire on the garage floor and put a wooden \nplatform on top of that to get the 'floor jack' high enough to\nraise the frame ... I't one TALLL truck...) lifted the spring\nfree of the axel.  Taking out the block gave me enough room to\nundo the pin holding the spring pack together.\n\nThe spring pack was held together with a nut on top and a round head\non the other end....  No wrench head...  Vice Grips worked fine...\nI soaked the nut with WD40 and it came right off.\n\nFlipped the bottom spring and then...\n\n>>Is this a nightmare waiting to happen, or an easy, though physically\n>>demanding, thing to do?\n>\n>Well, it's easier than doing a decent trigger job on a 1911A1 :-)\n>(OK, well, maybe it's not _that_ easy, but it's not terribly\n>difficult.)\n\nI donno ... I'm a little more sore today than after working on a\n1911A1 ...\n\nA 1.5 foot pipe cheater was a real help.  Torque spec for the U bolt\nnuts is 150 to 200 ft-lbs (!).   A 1911-A1 doesn't have that kind of\ntorque spec ...\n\nIt was a 'challenge' to get the 'pack bolt' back in the spring pack.  \nSqueeze pack with two hands, hold bolt with third, put nut on\nwith fourth while picking up wrench and vice grips with fifth\nand sixth hands ...  I used some string to tie the pack together\nwhile holding the pin in for alignment... then I could let go\nto get the {nut, wrench, Vice Grips...}.\n\nGetting the pin back lined up with the lift block was a challenge too...\nuntil I discovered that the axel had 1) Tilted and\/or 2) rolled forward.\n\nOne the drivers side, a bottle jack under the front of the differential\ntilted it back in line enough for the pin head to drop into the right\nhole.  On the passenger side, I had to wrestle the wheel into rolling\nforward about 1\/2 inch to get things to line up.  Spent more than an\nhour working on getting the pin head into the hole in the lift block\nwith levers and ropes and impliments of distruction before I took a \nbreak and thought about WHY it wasn't lined up anymore (since it HAD\nbeen lined up before, and *I* didn't move it, something ELSE must \nhave ... hmmm, axle no longer constrained not to move ... hmmm, move \nit back... hmmm...).\n\nAfter that, it was all much easier to 'close up'.\n\nBTW, the ride is now softer, but not quite as soft as I was hoping for.\nAt least it now sits level..\n\n-- \n\nE.

The Corolla never entered my mind.\nI should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4\/Dodge Stealth more.\nSince my list was exhausted, I bought the Probe.  :-)\n\nThe car design is different than earlier years, so it's too early to see its\nreliability so far.  For what it's worth, my comments:\n\nMy dislikes:\nShutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal.\nHeadlights have \"stuck\" up a few times (weather?)\nair conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch)\ncondensation around rear washer fluid container doesn't drain completely.\ncrammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical)\nparts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts\nunderside plastic doesn't like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical).\nassembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not \nstitched properly.  Hopefully just a fluke.\nFord only gives 1 key with the car.  C'mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies!\nRear hatch has no padding on corners when up.  I'm waiting for the day when\nI bash my head on the corner.\nhorn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference)\nTires fling dirt\/mud onto side of car \n\nMy Likes:\nengine (design\/valves\/sounds\/smoothness\/power\/mileage\/torque) -- definitely #1\nhandling (very good for FWD; understeer only at limits)\ntransmission (the 5 speed is a must)\nusable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere)\nVery little torque steer at full power (much better than the '90 SHO I drive)\nstability at 100+mph (high gearing though)\nlow cowl (good visibility in front)\nHeated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather)\nABS\/Air bag (see above)\nrear seats fold down (I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important)\nNo shake\/rattle noises when going over bumps\/potholes (still!)\nTires: 225\/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)\n\nAs you can see, I'm primarily interested in the engine.  While it doesn't\nhave the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling\npoint for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine.  \n\nThe overall car is a good buy for the money.  That market segment hasn't changed\nmuch since July (Prelude VTEC, Honda Del Sol??).  I drive it to and from work\neach day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the\nProbe's suspension doesn't like potholes.  When you test drive one, find a \npotholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable.\nIf you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They'll find\nthat they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides\ndifferently (if that's \"better\" is up to you).  Also, there's a lot of glass\naround you which I wasn't expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty\nhot in the summer.  My back seat passengers (now very few) complain about\nthe lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with\nthe heat.  I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine.\nLeather and the keyless entry system weren't available when I got the car so\nI can't comment on them (I got the car before it was officially announced).  \nI prefer cloth to leather anyway.  \n\nI wouldn't want this car in the snow:  The suspension is too rough for the\ninevitable surprise potholes, tires aren't meant for snow, and the seats assume\nthat you're not wearing lots of thick clothing.  Rain is much better:  water \ngenerally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper\ncontrols are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with the\nEagles (and I was really trying).  \nThere is also a definite lack of cup holder\/small storage places.  The GT\nhas map holders below the speakers in the door, but they're rigid plastic\nthat could fit two cassettes or CD's max.  The center console\/storage bin\/arm\nrest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth \"pouch\"\nbut that's it.  No change holders.  Quite a let-down from the SHO.\nAnd the Probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car!\n\nLastly, don't store wet car covers in the back.  The foam will soak the \nwater up and the result will *not* smell pleasant :-(.\n\nNathan\nnathan@sco.com\n\n>\n>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n>|Jeremy Mereness                 | Support     | Ye Olde Disclaimer:    |\n>|zonker+@cmu.edu (internet)      |    Free     |  The above represent my|\n>| FAST Project, CMU-GSIA         |     Software|   opinions, alone.     |\n>|B.S.

I'm selling a 1991 Dodge Stealth R\/T and I was contacted\nby this company called the Markham group based out of Illinois.  \n\nThey said they have 7-10 buyers in my area interested in my car or they wouldn't\nbe talking to me.  They talked to me for a good 20 minutes asking everything\nabout my car and said they could sell it no problem.  They guaranteed that if\nthey didn't sell my car in 75 days, I would get my money back ($389) and since\nI charged it, I'm protected by federal law which states that if I'm not satisfied,\nI would get a refund (which is true).  They federal expressed all the paperwork \nto me which had a contract stating their policy about the 75 days and such.\n\nI called up the BBB in Illinois and they do not have a file on them which is\ngood news.

We'll be riding some twisty, \n   fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).\n\nCommunication:  work out your own system.  Or just slow down and holler\nback every once in a while.  At reasonable speeds, even on my under-muffled\nMagna, we can hear each other.  It's only above, say, 45 MPH that you \ncan't really communicate.\n\nBalance: New passengers are a real pain, because you never know how\nthey're going to react to steering.  Some people catch on immediately\nand lean with me.  Others are completely skittish about the leaning\nthing, and keep their bodies perpendicular to the horizon.  This is a\npain while turning, but manageable.  The WORST are the passengers who stay\nperpendicular to the horizon, then REMEMBER in the middle of a turn\nand WHIP AROUND until they're in the `correct' position.  This always\nscrews up the line I've picked out.\n\nHere's my personal checklist of things to tell passengers:\n\t- attire: helmet, long pants, boots\/heavy shoes, jacket.\n\t- Keep feet on pegs at all times, unless I say otherwise.  Do not\n\t  get on\/off unless I say you can.  (I've had people try to dismount\n\t  in traffic, just as I'm pulling in to a parking space!)\n\t- Muffler gets HOT! ('Nuff said)\n\t- We get *GOOD* traction.  We're not going to fall over.  (Many\n\t  first-time riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn!)\n\t- Turn dynamics:  sit so that you feel like you're sitting upright and\n\t  we're going straight.  Trust your butt, not your eyes -- if you're\n\t  confused, close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel\n\t  of it.  Or just hug me tight.  \n\t- Please, no sudden moves -- shift your weight as desired, but be \n\t  gradual, so I can compensate.\n\t- Your faceplate is yours to open\/close as desired.\n\t- Trust is essential.  Trust the driver (me) to do the right \n\t  thing -- I've driven many miles on this thing, and know how\n\t  to operate it.  Enjoy the ride.  (This is important to\n\t  stress.  For example, one of my first-time passwngers seemed to \n\t  watch the speedo like a hawk:  I drove her to the beach down 84, \n\t  and whever we topped 35 mph, she'd holler, \"SLOW DOWN! I'M SCARED\" \n\t  I humored her for a while, then simply covered the speedometer with \n\t  the spare piece of duct tape I keep stuck to the top of the cluster.\n\t  Problem solved:  she watched the scenery instead of the\n\t  instruments, and had a much better time.  Based on her\n\t  experience driving a Lincoln Continental, she was unwilling to \n\t  trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike.)\n\nUsually I'll point out the controls, engine, transmission, brakes, \ntires, etc. and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for first-timers.\nHelps calm their nerves, and gives the bike a chance to warm up.\n\nWatch out for gravel on the Mt. Hamilton road:  there were lots of little\nmudslides after the last big rain; by now, many of the blind corners will\nbe nicely covered with a carpet of little, round, nearly invisible stones.\nIt doesn't help build trust when you slide out on a blind corner, on the \nfirst trip!\n\nGood luck -- have fun!\n--\nDON'T DRINK SOAP!

A family sedan designed to be\noperable at 85mph doesn't suddenly become operable at 130mph because\nyou added some plastic aero effects, slightly wider tires, and a much\nlarger engine.  That's what the SHO is -- a slightly modified family\nsedan with a powerful engine.  They didn't even bother improving the\n*brakes.*\n\nThe Mustang is essentially the same deal as the SHO -- a big power\nplant stuck in a mid-size sedan, with almost no other modifications.\nI have real-life experience with the Mustang -- it handles like a\nbrick (except when you're invoking oversteer, of course, something I\npersonally avoid doing on the highway) and stopping power is\ninadequate even from 80mph.  Lots of accelleration -- but the rest of\nthe car is not up to par.\n\nI picked the Porsche example because they are designed with speed in\nmind.  It didn't have to be the 911 -- it could have been the much\ncheaper 944 or one of several Mercedes or Audi models.  All of these\ncars are fairly expensive -- but so are the parts that make them\ndrivable at high speed.  This should be elementary.\n\nThere are a few things to keep in mind about Europe, since you brought\nit up.  My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly second-hand, but I believe\nthe following to be true:\n\n1. Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here.\n2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than\n   they are here, and usually include animal fences.  This makes them\n   far more predictable than most US highways.\n3. Not all of Europe is the Autobahn.  Most places in Europe have\n   speed limits that aren't out-of-line with what we used to have in\n   the US -- if my friends weren't lying to me they're typically not\n   much higher than 120km\/h.\n\nI strongly suspect you won't find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph\n(nearly 200km\/h) on the Autobahn, but I could be wrong.

The jacket fits me ok in the chest, slightly snug at the\nwaist, and too small in the arms.

The 2 piece is probably a little less comfortable around\nthe waist, just because of the extra layer of stuff, but maybe not.\n\nSo I'd have to vote for the two piece.

There is some kind of \"slip\" device in the shaft\nto prevent IT from breaking.

Once you've found a bike you're interested in, call\nsome insurance companies for rates.

It is just some generic made-in-Taiwan cable\nlock with the Kryptonite name on it.\n\nSecondly, the latch engagement mechanism is something of a joke.

Kinda Offical...\nSummary: Supposed \"Higher power output\".\nDistribution: rec.motorcycles\nKeywords: Using Splitfire plugs for performance.\nOrganization: University of Illinois at Urbana\nLines: 54\n\n\nYo, Whaz up!!!\n\nEarlier, I was reading on the net about using Splitfire plugs.  One\nguy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell.  Well,\nI saw one think that someone said about \"Show me a team that used Split-\nfires....\"  Well, here's some additional insight and some theories\nabout splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages.\n\nSplitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently and\nincreased power for the 4x4 cages.  Well, for these guys, splitfires\nincreased performance by increasing TORQUE.  They weren't focusing\non horsepower numbers.\n\nNow how does this related to us high performance pilots?  Well, that\ndepends.  Do you pilot a high performance 2- or 4-cylinder machine?\nIn the case of 4-cylinders, splitfires would increase overall torque,\nbut 4's make more top end horsepower with its torque packed down low.\nSo for 4's, splitfires would not significantly increase power.\n\nBut what about twins?...  Many of you 4 guys laugh at some of us twins,\nbut many times we carry less weight which sometimes can make up for\nthe hp loss (see Doug Polen vs. Scott Russell, Daytona 1992).  However,\ntwins make more torque thoughout their powerbands.   So how does this\ntranslate?  Increased torque should \"theoretically\" help twins make\nmore power.  Splitfire claims that there should be not extra mods\nor anything made, just stick 'em in.\n\nNow I don't know about all of this (and I'm trying to catch up with\nsomebody about it now), but Splitfires should help twins more than\n4's.        \n\nAs far as racing teams....  Ducati team \"Fast by Ferraci\" used\nsplitfires in the 1989 season (this is when they had Jamie James\nrunning for em), but I don't know why they stopped since then.\nAlso, somebody check to see if they had them in 88.....\n\nPeace.\n\nWarren\nwcd82671@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu\n\"Have Suzuki, will travel...\"\n\nAt a local \"fix-er-up-er\" shop, the bike repairest looked at a\ndumped ZX-7.  Then he asked the guy...\n\n\"What happened...\"   \"I dumped the clutch...\"\n\"How fast...\"        \"Pretty fast...\"\n\"Insurance...\"       \"Nope.\"\n\nThe fixer smiled.....\n\n\"What do you know about bikes?\"   \"Not much.....\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" motorcycles"}

Basically, stupidity will get you hurt\/killed a lot\nfaster on a motorcycle than in a car.  But with care, it is\nnot unreasonably dangerous.  Also, buying good protective\nclothing is helpful, that way if something does go wrong,\nyou are likely to be less severely injured.\n\nFirst thing, if possible take a (MSF) driver training course,\nthis will get you started on the right foot -- they teach\ncontrol of the vehicle and safe riding practices.\n\nSecond, buy protective gear.  At minimum a good helmet\nand a pair of leather gloves are a must.  A good sturdy \npiece of footgear is also very helpful, though leather hiking\nboots, a pair of old army boots, or something similar works fine\nfor this purpose as long as you make sure the laces stay \ntied.  After those, a leather jacket and leather pants or chaps\nare nice as well; but these are also expensive items.  For the\npants, many people consider a good pair of jeans to be reasonable,\npreferably recent and of a fairly heavy weight.  Similarly for\na jacket, a good jean jacket is a reasonable compromise, though\nmore people tend to have leather jackets around than pants.  Another\nthing to do is drop in on garage sales looking for a second-hand\nleather jacket.  Look for a fairly thick leather in these items.\n\nThird don't do anything stupid -- don't ride after \ndrinking, even one drink can noticeably affect you judgement\nand balance; don't ride in the snow, or when conditions\nare such that black ice is likely; be very careful riding\nin the rain -- slow way down, take corners gingerly, \nbrake early and gently;  try not to ride if you are sick,\ntired, taking any medication with drowsiness warnings, or\notherwise not in average shape.\n\nWith care, you should be ok.\n\n>The next question I have is what bike would you recommend for\n>a first time rider.

The maximum I can spend is about $2500 so\n>I'll be looking at a used bike.\n\nI would suggest mid to late 80's japanese mid-sized standard.\nSomething in 400-650 cc range would probably be reasonable.  If\nyou are shorter\/lighter than average, you might want to go as\nlow as a 300-400 cc bike.\n\nPossible models: \nThe Suzuki GS### series (eg. GS500, GS650, etc.).  These are generally\ninline 4 bikes, generally dependable except for a tendency to \nweakness in the charging system.  (Stator and\/or Regulator\/Rectifier \nproblems.)  My first bike was a (about '82) GS650, it server me well.\n\nThe Honda Nighthawk series (this may also be known as the CB### series\nI think).  eg. Honda CB450, CB650, etc.  This is another series of\nstandard motorcycles.  Also fairly dependable.\n\nKawasaki and Yamaha probably have similar bikes, but I don't know\nthem as well.\n\nFor mid to late '80s models of the above, you should be able to\nbuy the bike for under $2000, leaving you money for protective \nclothing and insurance and licensing costs.\n\nHope this helps,\n-David\n(dagibbs@qnx.com)\n\n###\n\n","completion":" motorcycles"}
{"prompt":"From: keller@hubble.ifa.hawaii.edu (Tim Keller)\nSubject: airhorns on an FJ1100 review            \nOrganization: Institute for Astronomy, Hawaii\nLines: 44\n\nFor those of you who are thinking about fiamms, you might also want to think\nabout airhorns. I just installed a set of Bosch air horns ordered from \nDennis Kirk (pg. 282 of the latest catalog) on my '85 FJ1100. They are rated\nat 93db at 7 meters. I installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery to\nthe relay to the compressor to ground. My stock horn connectors fit the relay\npins just fine. I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor, and used\na crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse\/connector from NAPA.\n\tI installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front\nfairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube\nframe used to support the front fairing. You have to remove the front fairing to\ndo this, but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two\nvertical supports just in front of the fuses. Depending how tight your fairing\nfollows the frame, you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing.\nThe compressor is about 2\" in diameter and about 5\" long.\n\tThe relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame (it is small\nso there should be plenty of good places for it.\n\tI found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to\nmount. The horns fit inside the front fairing\/frame and stick out on either side\njust in front of the air scoops, but behind the turn signals. The back of the\nhorns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where\nthe gas tank connects to the front part of the frame. There is just enough\nroom to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance, and there are nice\ncut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into.\n\tThe short horn is even with the fairing, and the long one sticks out\nabout an inch or so, but it is really not that noticable unless you look\nclosely. They end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straight\nahead (perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you).\n\tIf you have any other questions about the mounting, email, and I can try\nto explain better. If your bike is not red, then you may want to paint them\nfirst.\n\tHow do they work you ask? They are very, very, very *LOUD*. They sound\nmore like a european sports car than a truck, but a vast improvement over stock.\nI have used them at least daily since installing them, and the 10 amp fuse has\nnot blown yet (although, the duration of the horn blasts have been short).\n\tI've repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them, even though\nthey know that I have the horns, they still jump. They are perfect for keeping\nthe pedestrians on the sidewalk.\nThe bottom line is they work, are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to\nthose stupid lane changing cages (as well as take a few years off their lives)\nand are relatively easy to install on the FJ.

Frankly, the Saturn\nway of doing business and service was a *very* big plus. I hadn't bought a new\ncar since I bought my Honda 4WD back in '85, and I was unbelieveably offended by\nmost salespeople I met.\n\nSaturn was indeed very different. I made three different visits to the dealer where\nI bought my car, and was never pressured. Saturn also had the best after-sales\nsupport, and the fixed pricing made it *very* easy for me to decide exactly what\nI wanted to buy. Another big selling point was running into my mechanic at the\ndealer. He's been fixing imports for 20 years...and bought a Saturn, based on\nwhat he's seen and heard from his customers. \n\nSaturn also has a good extended warranty program; $675 for 6 year\/60K miles, \nfully refunded if you don't use it. That works out to an actual cost of $170 or\nso, based on the 6 year treasury rates. Using savings account rates it's more\nlike $120. In the first three years it also buys you free rental during any\nwarranty work, without counting against the refund.\n\n--mike\n\n###\n\n","completion":" autos"}

Your problem in the wet is call hydroplaning.\nYou may not have enough tread left to channel water out from under the\ntire - so it goes fishy on you as it lifts off the road.\n\n(2) Tires age.

The point of formal training \nmust be to prepare riders for the road. Preparedness is in my opinion\nto know as much as possible. So, to exclude some aspects of riding a bike \nin a course is wrong IMHO. Now to countersteering in particular.\nCountersteering is something that must be trained. A common reaction among \nnew bikers (or bicycle riders) in an emergency situation, is to steer the \nmotorcycle like a bicycle. As we know this makes the motorcycle go in the\ndirection opposite to what was intended. Needless to say, this is dangerous.\nI have a specific example: A rider in a left turn. The rider thinks he\/she\nis to close to the right shoulder of the road, and tries to steer the \nmotorcycle to the left by pulling the left handle and pushing the right \nhandle. The motorcycle straightens up and goes off the road. \nA worse scenario: The same rider, same turn. In the middle of the turn\nthe rider sees a truck coming towards him\/her. The panicking rider tries\nto steer the motorcycle away from the truck and crashes right into it.\n\nThe main function of a riding course is to teach how to avoid emergency \nsituations, AND what to do if in one. Thus, the knowledge (and training) of\ncountersteering is IMHO a must in any riding course.\n-- \nstaal@idt.unit.no\n\n###\n\n","completion":" motorcycles"}

{"prompt":"Subject: After-Market Cruise Controls: Specific Questions\nFrom: MikeW@Canc.byu.edu (M.D. (Mike) Wieda)\nOrganization: BYU\nNntp-Posting-Host: 128.187.203.40\nLines: 82\n\nHowdy,\n\nI'm a little new to this newsgroup, but I would like to tap some of the\nknowledge and expertise available here.\n\nThe Subject:  After-market cruise controls\n\nThe Background:\nI recently broke my ankle in a road-bicycling accident (4 places, five \nscrews, yuk! :-( ).  In two weeks I will be returning to Texas (my\nhome) from my school (BYU) in Provo, Utah.  As you can imagine, trying to\ndrive nearly 1300 miles with a broken right ankle isn't just the epitome of\na good time.  My car does not have a cruise control, so I would have to do\nall the pedalling (ha ha) with my messed-up ankle.\n\nMy question:\nWhat is the general opinion of after-market cruise control units?  I\nrealize that a cheap CC (cruise control) from, say, Pep Boys, isn't going to\nbe as good as a factory or professionally installed unit (if there is such a\nthing).  And I uderstand that I probably can't expect much in the way of\naccuracy, looks and that sort of thing;  But anything's gotta be better than\ntrying to drive with a hosed ankle.\n\nI have a 1984 Jeep Cherokee, 4 speed, standard, 4*4, 2.5L engine with\nkettering(sp?) ignition (y'know, distributor cap, rotor, that set-up--not\nelectronic.  Maybe you could've guessed it being an '84, but I'm just trying\nto give information as completly as I can).\n\nI found a CC unit for 80 bucks.  It seems to use the vehicles vacuum system \ninstead of an electric servor\/motor.  Is this good or bad?  If I did buy\nthis CC, which vacuum hose should I tap?\n\nIt has two speed sensors:  One magnetic, and one that gets a signal from the \nnegative side of the distributor, kinda like a tach pick-up, or so I\nunderstand.  I can use either one.  Which is best?  The manual says (I read\nit in the store today) that the magnetic\/axle set-up is more accurate, but\nharder to install.  Is there really a big difference?\n\nIt has a sensor for the brake pedal, just like other CCs, but does NOT have a\nsensor for the clutch pedal.  So if I wasn't paying real close attention I\nmight push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up.  Which\nwould wind the engine up kinda high until I got my wits about me and turned \nthe thing off.  I'm pretty coordinated, so this doesn't bother me, if it\nwere for my girlfriends car, *then* it would bother me, but I'm ok with it.\n\nThe installation also calls for an attachment to a steady-on brake signal\nand a switched-on brake signal.  I think I can get a switched brake signal\nfrom the correct side of the brake light blade fuse.  Am I right?  But I'm\nnot sure where to get the steady-on brake signal, or, for that matter, what\nexactly it is?  Any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get\nit?\n\nI think I can figure the other things out.  Like how to hook-up the negative\nside tach-type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit, and the ground and\nall that miscellaneous business.  But I need a little help with:\n\n\t1.  Is it worth the money and safety risk (if any) for such a\n\t    device?\n\t2.  Is there any particularly good after-market CC?\n\t3.  Are \"professionally\" installed CCs signifacantly better and\n\t    worth the cabbage?\n\t4.  If the unit I saw (sorry, no manufacturer or model number, just\n\t    that it is at Pep Boy and its $80) is sufficient for my simple \n\t    needs, how do I get the thing installed properly (specifically,\n\t    the questions above)?\n\nMy father and I built a \"Veep\" (Volkswagen powered Jeep CJ-2A) when I was in\nhigh school, so I consider myself fairly good with tools, electronics, and\ncars.  So the installation doesn't scare me.  I just want to be certain that\nI get the thing installed correctly as my Cherokee is just a wee bit more\ncomplicated than my Veep. :-)\n\nI appreciate your time in reading my post, and I would appreciate any\nexpertise or opinion anybody has on the subject.  If you would like to share\nsome of your wisdom, please email as I don't get over this group very often\n(but I check my mail all the time).\n\nAgain, thanks for any help anyone may have.\n\nMike Wieda\nMikew@canc.byu.edu\n\n###\n\n","completion":" autos"}

I kid you not.\n\nThis is very bad advice.  Helmets have two major impact absorbing\nlayers... a hard outer shell and a closed-cell foam impact layer.\nMost helmets lose their protective properties because the inner liner\ncompacts over time, long before the outer shell is damaged or\ndelaminates from age.  Dr. Hurt tested helmets for many years\nfollowing his landmark study and has estimated that a helmet can lose\nup to 80% of it's effectiveness from inner liner compression.  I have\na video he produced that discusses this phenomenon in detail.\n\nPuncture compression of the type caused by mirrors, sissy bars, and\nother relatively sharp objects is the worst offender.  Even when the\ncomfort liner is unaffected, dents and holes in the foam can seriously\ndegrade the effectiveness of a helmet.  If you are in the habit of\n\"parking your lid\" on the mirrors, I suggest you look under the\ncomfort liner at the condition of the foam.  If it is significantly\ndamaged (or missing :-), replace the helmet.\n--\nJerry Lotto <lotto@lhasa.harvard.edu>         MSFCI, HOGSSC, BCSO, AMA, DoD #18\nChemistry Dept., Harvard Univ.  \"It's my Harley, and I'll ride if I want to...\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" motorcycles"}

I won the battle but \nlost the war.  The arbitrator found that the car was \ndefective, but decided to offer a repurchase well below \nmarket value :(.  At the time of the hearing, average \nretail on my truck in the NADA book was $21,025, but \nthe decision was for  $17,665.  I wrote a letter to the \nCouncil of Better Business Bureaus pointing out the \nfact that if you have an automobile that does not \ndepreciate rapidly, the manufacturer has no incentive \nto deal with you.  There is no way that the \nmanufacturer can loose because they can turn around and \nsell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded \na repurchase.  The attitude of Chevrolet's \nrepresentative at the hearing tends to support this \npoint of view;  he was totally unprepared and did not \nseem to take the proceeding very seriously.\n\nI decided to take the repurchase, even though I am \ngetting totally screwed on the price.  I will not have \nto deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon \nmyself, and I have no case for a civil suit based on \nthe Idaho lemon law.  I am planning to send a letter to \nmy elected representatives telling them how utterly \nridiculous the Idaho lemon law is.  The law allows for \na \"use deduction\" equal to the IRS mileage allowance.  \nAs if Chevrolet were buying my gas and paying \nfor my insurance.\n\nSummary of the case:  In May 1992 I bought a new 3\/4 ton\nHD Chevrolet pickup.  Between May 1992 and December 1992 \nthis vehicle required repair after repair.  Systems \nthat required attention included the transmission, \nheater fan, paint, suspension, and motor.  The main \nproblem was the five speed manual transmission.  They \ncould not install a non-defective transmission in at \nleast four attempts.\n\nSo, in summary, it is possible to get a repurchase, but \nyou are going to get screwed on the price, unless you \npaid too much in the first place, or if your car \nhappens to be a model that depreciates rapidly.\n\njackw@hpdmd48.boi.hp.com\n\n###\n\n","completion":" autos"}

Wade) writes:\n>\n>ok, how about this to argue about.  why does the sl2 have a much lower base\n>price than the sc2???  it's over 1k cheaper(i forget the exact amount).\n>doesn't it cost more to have the extra doors\/windows\/locks\/motors etc. that \n>are in the 4 door????  perhaps it is just a marketing deal....people want the\n>2door, so they will pay the extra 1.2k???\n\nOk, here's what I understand:\n\nThe SL\/SL1\/SL2\/SW1\/SW2 was meant to compete with the following cars:\n\nHonda Civic\nToyota Tercel (SL,SL1)\nToyota Corolla (SL1,SL2)\nNissan Sentra\nMazda 323\/Protoge'\nSubaru Loyale\/Impreza\nIsuzu Stylus\nGeo Prizm\nFord Escort\nMercury Tracer\nMistubishi Mirage\nPlymouth\/Dodge Colt\n\n\nTheir core competition is the Civic, Corolla, and Sentra.  Most of the other\nmodels are in the same class, but aren't the first cars you would think of.\nI threw in the Escort\/Tracer because it has a good amount of Japanese\ntechnology and has similar reliability stats.  I didn't include domestic small\ncars such as the Cavalier, Sunbird, Shadow, Sundance, Tempo, and Topaz, since I\nthink Saturn is going after cars that have at least some degree of Japanese\nroots.\n\nThe SC1\/SC2 was meant to compete against the following cars:\n\nToyota Paseo\nHonda Civic Si\/Civic Coupes\/del Sol Si\nNissan NX1600\/NX2000\nMazda MX-3\nIsuzu Impulse\nGeo Storm\nFord Escort GT\n\n\nIf you look at the prices of these cars, they're more expensive than they're\n4-door counterparts.  The is good reason for this.  It is a more upscale and\ntrend-driven market.  Even though many of these models are based on sedan\nplatforms, their interior, etc. is good enough to warrant slightly higher\nprices.  Here are some of the platform derivations I can think of:\n\nTercel -> Paseo\nSentra -> NX1600\/NX2000\nCivic -> del Sol\n323 -> MX-3 (not sure on this one)\nStylus -> Impulse\/Storm\n\nTo illustrate, a Tercel starts at around $8000, while the Paseo starts at\naround $11,000.  Even a 4-door Tercel will cost less than a 2-door Paseo.  Now,\nyou might be saying that the Tercel doesn't offer the power that some 4-doors\noffer.  What I mean is that there is no 4-dr Tercel with a comparable\npowerplant as its sport coupe derivative.  Let's take another example: the\nIsuzu Stylus XS and Impulse XS\/Storm GSi.  Both have the same powerplants (a\n1.6L 140hp engine), but the smaller 2-dr coupes are generally more expensive.\nAgain, this is because the two-door sport coupe market is a more\nfashion-oriented and trend-setting segment.  People are willing to pay more\nmoney for this type of car.  \n\n\nIn short, even though the SC1\/SC2 may be smaller, hence \"less\" car, it's market\norientation dictates a slightly higher price than its mechanically equivalent\nsedan (SL1\/SL2) version.\n\nI hope this clears things up a bit......\n\n\nMihir Shah\n\n###\n\n","completion":" autos"}

I pulled over at first opportunity to sus out the damage. \nMy bike is a Kawasaki GPX250R with footpegs that are hinged and sprung such\nthat they fold upward and backward on contact with ground etc., and on the\nlower extreme corner of each peg there is mounted a \"bank-follower\", or a\nlittle stud that theoretically is the first bit to hit the ground in a\n100%-banked turn.  The stud is mounted on the footpeg by a threaded bit about 7\nmm long, which screws into a threaded hole in the footpeg.  Now for the\nmystery.\n\nThe stud on the side of the bike that clunked when I turned was absent.  I'm\nfairly sure it was there before the event.  There was no damage to the end of\nthe footpeg where the stud would ordinarily have been.  In fact, the thread in\nthe hole in the footpeg was perfectly intact, with no evidence of something\nhaving been forcefully ripped out of it only moments previously.  \n\nOkay all you engineering types, how the f**k do you explain this ?  How can you\nrip a tightly fitting steel thread out of a threaded hole (in alloy) without\ndamaging the thread in the hole ?  Is this some sort of hi-tech design thingo\nthat Kawasaki never mentioned, like that the end of the footpeg suddenly\nchanges phase on impact, to let the stud rip out, then changes back to a solid\n?  I'm quite amazed at how this could have happened.  In the meantime, life\ngoes on, without a left-hand bank-follower.\n\nBarry Manor DoD# 620 confused accidental peg-scraper\n\n###\n\n","completion":" motorcycles"}

I had an alignment problem, but\nthey tried to tell me that the K frame was bent, and about 2000 dollars of\nwork\/parts to fix it.

For\nabout a year before I sold the car, I said to myself, it's a good car, I\njust can't find anybody competent enough the fix it.  In the end, before I\ntraded it in for a Saturn, the power steering started acting up again.  I\njust stopped putting money into it.  I must have put at least $5000-$7000\nworth of repairs over it's lifetime.  I am sorry but Lee Iacocca can bite\nme.  Bullshit, whoever backs em best, is just afraid the stupid things are\ngoing to fall apart, and no one will buy them without assurance, why the\nhell do you think that LH has been nicknamed Last Hope.\n\nYou can do better, and I know people will disagree with me here, but\nJapanese, like Honda, or Toyota, or the only american car company that I\nfeel is a quality product, Saturn.  I will not touch another chrysler\nproduct again, no way.  I don't care how good the LH cars look good, and I\nwill admit they look promising, but not with the support that you get.  GM\nisn't much better, thank god, they don't control Saturn, like they do\ntheir divisions, or it would be just another marketing ploy.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, i will be watching my car (which I do like) like a\nhawk for the next 4 years.  I am much more hesitant to say it (or any) car\nis really good, until it has proved itself to me.\n\nBut since someone else pointed out C&D as a source.  I will note, because\nI used to read these magazines, that Car and Driver has never had a good\nthing to say about most Chrysler products (Shadow for one), always were\nthey moaning about the reguritated K-car, and engine.  Whereas Motor Trend\nalways thought they were great cars.  No car magazine is really objective.\n\nAnd although there are alot of people who don't like Consumers Reports, I\nwill use them to reinforce my argument (I already know about the big stink\nwith the Saturn crash tests, time will tell how good a car they are), the\nshadow\/sundance rate much worse than average, in fact none of the\nchrysler's rate a better than average, I think the best one is just\naverage.  Excluding the diamond star\/mitsubishi stuff and the LH's.  You\ncan find bad stuff about the Shadow.  Try as I might, when I researched\nthe Saturn, I could not find anything bad about it.  There is a great deal\nof information about this company, just because it is a new american\ncompany and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community, for\ngood reason.  Much more than the introduction of any new model lines of\nany established company.  I read an article, which had a sub-column, an I\nthink this imprinted on me more than anything else.  Some big wig in\nToyota said and I quote, \"We are watching them very closely.\"  Come on,\neverybody grow up, the foreign cars, especially the japanese have been\nkicking our butts, for good reason, the american car companies could not make\na good product or support the customer the way they want these days, to\nset in their ways, which is one of the reasons Saturn was created.

The\npull-off, which is vacuum actuated, provides a necessary pull in non-cold\nweather conditions to get the idle off the the fast idle cam. Locate the\nfast idle cam on your vehicle and see if you can rotate it to produce a\nnormal idle. If so, locate the diaphram and test it.

{"prompt":"From: michal+@cs.cmu.edu (Michal Prussak)\nSubject: \"Illegal\" tint windows\nNntp-Posting-Host: gs58.sp.cs.cmu.edu\nOrganization: School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon\nLines: 38\n\nI know it's a long shot, but maybe someone went through this and will have\nsome comments to share.\n\nThe story is this: I bought a car out of state, and I'm trying to get\nthe safety inspection in Pennsylvania. The problem is that the car has \naftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield. The tint is rather\nweak, and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint.\n\nThe inspection garage said that they won't pass it unless I get a\nwaiver from the state police. So I went to the state police - the\nofficer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal, and I can get a\nwaiver only for a pre-84 car or for a medical reason. I asked him to\nshow me the section of the vehicle code that says it's illegal.  He\nshowed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can't have tint, if\nyou can't see the inside of the car because of the tint. When I told\nhim that you can in fact see the inside very well, he shut the book\nand said \"It's just illegal, and in fact we can have someone give you\na ticket for it right now.\" Well, won't argue with that...\n\nSince the vehicle code says it's OK as long as you can see through the\ntint, I'd like to keep it (I'll re-read the vehicle code in the\nlibrary).  I'd also like to get some sort of paper from the police\nthat says it's OK, so I can get the inspection, and so that I won't\nget in trouble for the tint later on. I also wouldn't mind registering\na complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off.\n\nSo does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from\nthe police, especially in Pennsylvania? Does anyone have any experience\nregistering a complaint against an officer? I called the station \nlater on today, but they basically said there is no place where I\ncould register a complaint against an officer... And if I do decide\nto keep the tint and get a ticket anyway, how much of a chance do\nI stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court?\n\nAny comments about it will be welcome!\n\nMichal\n\n###\n\n","completion":" autos"}

I wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax\nand license and told them I'd be back that evening to pick up the truck.  \nWhen I returned, I had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could  \nget to me. When I finally got in there, everything went smoothly until he  \nstarted adding up the numbers. He then discovered that they had  \nmiscalculated the tax & license by about $150. He then said he needed  \nanother $150 from me. I said we had already agreed on a price and it was  \ntheir problem, I wasn't giving them any more money. The finance guy then  \nbrought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time. I  \nreminded him that I was the customer and I didn't think I should be  \ntreated like that and that if he didn't back off he could forget the whole  \ndeal. He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it,  \nsnatched back my check and left. Needless to say, they were not pleased by  \nthe turn of events.\n\nEarly the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting  \nto know what happened. I related the story and he apologised profusely and  \nasked if there was anything they could do to change my mind. I told him  \nthat if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldn't take it,  \nthat there were other dealers in town, I was a repeat customer of theirs  \nand that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...I was still  \npretty steamed about the whole affair. He gave me the line about hating to  \nlose a customer and they would try to find a solution, etc, etc. I told  \nhim not to bother, thanks, I'd go somewhere else.\n\nA couple hours later, the owner of the dealership called me, all  \napologetic, etc, etc, etc, and said that they would cover the $150 plus  \nknock another $400 off the price of the truck. I told him I'd think about  \nit and he gave me his private, direct phone number, his secretary's name,  \nand assured me that they valued me as a customer, etc etc etc....\n\nI thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we  \ndecided, what the hell...that was a pretty decent deal, so I called him  \nback and accepted his offer. When I went back the next day to pick up the  \ntruck, I received the royal treatment. Everyone seemed to know about the  \nincident, even the lot boy. Everything went smoothly and I was out of  \nthere in my new truck in about 30 mins.\n\nSo, I guess I'm a reasonably satisfied customer. However, it should not  \nhave happened in the first place. I was a bit shocked to have a sales  \nperson talk to me like that. I don't expect them to bow and grovel, but I  \nsure don't expect to be given a hard time either, esp. when it's their  \nmistake.\n\nAnyway, I'm happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred  \ndollars under invoice and they paid most of the first year's license fee.  \nI'm not sure whether I'll go back to that dealer, tho.\n\nMark\n\n###\n\n","completion":" autos"}

My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly second-hand, but I believe\n>the following to be true:\n\nMy knowledge about driving in the U.S. is also second-hand, but I think I can\ncorrect your statements about our Autobahn:\n\n>1. Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here.\n\nOh yeah, that would be paradise... in fact, you can forget it. From all I've\nheard from my U.S. relatives, drivers esp. here in Germany are much more agg-\nressive, but not disciplined. One of my relatives, a L.A. resident, hired a car\nat the Nuernberg airport and went about 18 miles to our home. He said then that\nhe grew about 1 year older during this ride and swore he'd never drive a car in\nGermany again (this was in 1982 and he kept his promise - the situation now is\neven worse as effect of the increased volume of traffic).\nWhat you mean by `better disciplined' should perhaps be considered `cautious due\nto fear': \nWhen driving around here, you always *have* to take into consideration that the\nmajority of the other drivers absolutely relies on you: They expect that nobody\nfails or sleeps; many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car can\ngo (of course only where that is allowed, you might think - dream on :).\nSo any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health - and if you're ex-\nposed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver, you learn to\nhandle it - or you lose... \nThat's the way I and most people I know experience our traffic situation - \nwhether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you; I think we handle\na very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest (compared to\nthe volume) and decreasing rates of lethal accidents - OTOH, more and more\npeople (esp. women) dislike driving (because they feel overtaxed and threatened)\nand each accident is one accident too much.\n\n>2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than\n>   they are here, and usually include animal fences.  This makes them\n>   far more predictable than most US highways.\n\nBetter designed and maintained, may be - but animal fences are very rare. Auto-\nbahnen and many other streets have guard-rails (I hope that's the right word - \na plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights; it's about 2 feet high);\nthose guard-rails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road. Smaller animals\ncan crawl under the plank, bigger ones can easily jump over it. The point is\nthat esp. larger animals are very rare in Germany; they tend also to be very\ntimid. Accidents caused by animals are a neglegible danger.\n\n>3. Not all of Europe is the Autobahn.  Most places in Europe have\n>   speed limits that aren't out-of-line with what we used to have in\n>   the US -- if my friends weren't lying to me they're typically not\n>   much higher than 120km\/h.\n\nYou're right (there are speed linits even on the major part of the Autobahn) -\nbut the attitude towards driving (see above) seems to be very similar to that\nin Germany (I've been in France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Spain, Belgium,\nthe Netherlands) - besides that, you really can't rely on the residents abiding\nthe local speed limits. I've got quite a lot of practise (~120k miles) and I'm\nused to travel at 130 mph (FYI, with a car even smaller than a rabbit), but I\nconsider driving on the highways round Paris or Milano really a thrill...\n\n>I strongly suspect you won't find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph\n>(nearly 200km\/h) on the Autobahn, but I could be wrong. ...\n\nSorry, but you'll find quite a lot rabbit-class-car (or even smaller, mine is a\nPeugeot 205) owners going that fast; small cars with much HP are very `hip' over\nhere - and most people buying such cars aren't afraid to let them run.\n\n>                                                      ...  Some people\n>have no respect for their own lives.\n\nI disagree; the size or weight of a car is rather irrelevant. Formula-1 cars\nweigh less than 700 kg and the drivers have a chance to survive accidents at\n130 mph or higher - OTOH when crashing against a solid object at 130 mph,\nit makes no difference whether you sit in a Porsche, a Mercedes, a tank or on\na bicycle: Your're dead.\n\nBye,\nStefan\n---\nStefan Dalibor (dalibor@immd3.uni-erlangen.de)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\"...And now for the next case in Kangaroo Court, I accuse you of being the\nreincarnation of Adolf Hitler.

I believe I discussed countersteering a horse\nbefore.\n\nBasically, there are two ways to steer a horse, plow-rein and\nneck-rein.  Plow-reining steers him by keeping the reins separate, and\nyou pull in the direction you wish to go.  Neck-reining steers a horse\nby holding the reins together in one hand, and pulling against the\nhorse's neck in the direction you wish to go.  When training a\nplow-steering horse to neck-rein, one technique is to cross the reins\nunder his necks.  Thus, when neck-reining to the left, the right rein\npulls against the right side of the neck, but the left side of the bit\n(which the horse is used to from his plow-reining days).\n\nAre you sorry you asked yet?\n\n---\nEd Green, former Ninjaite |I was drinking last night with a biker,\n  Ed.Green@East.Sun.COM   |and I showed him a picture of you.

I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the\napproved method: Slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target,\nthen take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, it\ndidn't work because I didn't have time. Riding up the hill leading to my\nhouse, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to\nthe Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to\nthe Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to\nharm.\n\nBut I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the\nroughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph\nfor the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the\nleft side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he\nhad been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away,\nheading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I\nsaw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I took\nthe dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was\ndriven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent\nmarks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think\nI saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this\nmoment is hazy.\n\nI next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The\napologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut\nmouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my\nshin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not.\nSo I'm left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!\n\nInterestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never\nmoved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike\noff course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some\ngut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me\nhere, as I didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.\n\nWhat worries me about the accident is this: I don't think I could have\nprevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not\nnecessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was\nriding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if\nit had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the\nthought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a\nblind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter, how many driveways are\nlong enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?\n\nI eagerly await comment.\n\nRyan Cousinetc.|1982 Yamaha Vision XZ550 -Black Pig of Inverness|Live to Ride\nKotRB          |1958 AJS 500 C\/S -King Rat                      |to Work to\nDoD# 0863      |I'd be a squid if I could afford the bike...    |Flame to\nryan.cousineau@compdyn.questor.org  |   Vancouver, BC, Canada   |Live . . .\n\n\n * SLMR 2.1a * \"He's hurt.\" \"Dammit Jim, I'm a Doctor -- oh, right.\"\n                                                                                       \n----\n+===============================================================+\n|COMPUTER DYNAMICS BBS    604-255-9937(HST)    604-986-9937(V32)|\n|Vancouver, BC, Canada -  Easy Access, Low Rates, Friendly Sysop|\n+===============================================================+\n\n###\n\n","completion":" motorcycles"}

I don't\n>have my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information:\n>\n>[...]  Any stories on how you all learned?\n\nI'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do.\n\nEarly in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on\nhis old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so I\nactually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.\n\nI proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and\nrode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to\ninvest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then\nI also passed my road test.\n\nOn May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a\n4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb),\nI had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late,\nskidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the\noncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was\nalso stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under\na car and been killed.\n\nNow this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the\nExperienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training\ncould have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater\nsince you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff\nas I did.\n\nSo my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I\nwouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you\nhappen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until\nyou're ready to use it.\n\n>1)  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have \n>to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I'm too \n>ignorant to know I need to buy)\n\nWhile you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in\nDC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you\nsave up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear,\nplus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure\nthe machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up\nmachine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration\nand licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not\nincluding the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.\n\n>2)  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance?  I turn 18 in \n>about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up\n>till now, and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a \n>motorcycle is going to insure (I live in Washington DC if that makes\n>a difference)\n\nI pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200\nin Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial\ncoverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be\npoor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo\nmore expensive.\n\n>3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy\/where I should look for it?\n\nThere used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle\nmagazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or\nrecent models might be available.  You could probably look through\npast issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first\nbike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice\ninstead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that\nare parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by\nnoticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around\nand they were generally set up the way I wanted.\n\nNothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting\nshowrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping,\nwere very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and\nquoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hence\ncheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.\n\n-- David Karr (karr@cs.cornell.edu)\n-- '80 BMW R65   DoD #0969   also BMWMOA, NRA, ACLU, et al.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" motorcycles"}

Firstly, motorcycles do not steer\nthemselves - only the rider can do that. Secondly, it is the adhesion of the\ntyre on the road, the suspension geometry  and the ground clearance of the\n motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles, and\nnot the knowledge of physics between the rider's ears. Are you seriously\nsuggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster\nor more competentlY than you could manage otherwise??\n\n\n>Mike, I'm extremely gratified for you that you have such a natural\n>affinity and prowess for motorcycling that formal training was a total\n>waste of time for you (assuming your total \"training\" hasn't come from\n>simply from reading rec.motorcycles).

I found out about countersteering about six years ago,\nfrom a physics lecturer who was also a motorcyclist. I didn't believe him\nat first when he said I steered my bike to the right to make it turn left,\nbut I went out and analysed closely what I was doing, and realized he was \nright! It's an interesting bit of knowledge, and I've had a lot of fun since\nthen telling others about it, who were at first as sceptical as I was. But\nthat's all it is - an interesting bit of knowledge, and to claim that\nit is essential for all bikers to know it, or that you can corner faster\nor better as a result, is absurd.\n\nFormal training is in my view absolutely essential if you're going to\nbe able to ride a bike properly and safely. But by including countersteering\ntheory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily, right at\nthe time when there are *far* more important matters for them to learn.\nAnd that was my original point.\n\nMike\n\n###\n\n","completion":" motorcycles"}

This is\n  a very good dirt bike and has been maintained perfectly.  I never had\n  any problems with it.\n\n  It's a four stroke, 4 valves, liquid cooled engine. It is heavier than \n  a 250 2 stroke but still lighter than a Honda XR600 and has a lot better \n  suspension (Ohlins shock, Husky fork) than the XR. For the casual or non\n  competitive rider, the engine is much better than any two stroke.\n  You can easily lug up hills and blast through trails with minimum gear\n  changes.\n  \n  The 1992 ignition and the carefully tuned carburation makes this bike\n  very easy to start (starts of first kick when cold or hot).  There is a\n  custom made carbon\/kevlar (light 1 pound) wrap around skid plate to protect\n  the engine cases and the water pump.  The steering angle has been reduced \n  by 2 degree to increase steering quickness. This with the suspension tune-up\n  by Phil Douglas of Aftershock (Multiple time ISDE rider) gives it a better\n  ride than most bike: plush suspension, responsive steering with no head shake.\n\n  So if it is such a good bike why sell it???? Gee, I want to buy a Husaberg,\n  which just a husky but 25 pounds lighter... and a tad more $$$.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" motorcycles"}

An on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of\n      directions and clues guiding participates around the \n      Joliet\/Plainfield area.  The object is to navigate a course\n      based on a set of directions and clues.  Participants will\n      be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which\n      they must answer along the way.  Points are awarded for the\n      number of correct answers given.  Directions will ultimately \n      lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is \n      set-up.  At various locations in the on-road course, check-points\n      will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions\n      or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,\n      basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.\n\n   2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants\n      will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and\/or hill climbs.\n      Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles\n      without getting stuck.  If you should get stuck (which is half\n      the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle\n      unstuck so you can try it again.  The off-road course will\n      divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified\n      4x4s can run the course.\n     \n  At the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring\n  participants.

Some where\nharder than others to shift but generally the higher the milage the smoother\nquicker & easier they where to shift.\n\nMy technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently\nwrist back on the shift lever. If for some reason I miss the shift window,\nI lightly press the accelerator & try agian. I've found that clutchless\nshifting is eaiser\/quicker at high rpms (4000-7000).
